A course website and planning documents for Physics, as taught at Seattle Academy of Arts and Sciences.

This is essentially a college-level course, taught using calculus (though with gentle introductions to all calculus concepts as needed, as some students taking the class have not yet completed Calculus.  

The course uses the new Eric Mazur textbook, `Principles and Practice of Physics <http://www.pearsonhighered.com/mazur1einfo/>`_.



Currently using a modification of the elegant theme, elegant-course.


To modify for use: 

 0. fork a copy of the repo for use in your course

 1. search for TODO tags in the files to modify to suit your course

 2. run make all to generate the site 


Recommended:

 Create a "base" branch for the course with all the boilerplate established.  

 Create branches from the base for each iteration of the course.



Usage:

  make all
