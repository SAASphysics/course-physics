Every year the American Association of Physics Teachers (`AAPT <http://www.aapt.org/Programs/contests/photocontest.cfm>`_) runs a photography contest.  Entries depict phenomena from physics, and are accompanied by a caption explaining the physics concepts that help one to understand the pictured phenomenon.  Winners receive cash prizes and have their photos published on the AAPT website, on calendars, and posters that are displayed in physics classrooms across the country.

I (Mark) have always wanted to have some students win this contest, and this year, I think we can.

Your entries will be judged for class credit for artistic and scientific merit, for both the image and for the explanatory caption.  While you are not required to do this project, it is one option you have for demonstrating broad understanding of the topics we cover this year, and is one way to earn the "scientific communicator" badge.
