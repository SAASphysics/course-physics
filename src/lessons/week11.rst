:summary: Using momentum to figure stuff out 
:category: lessons
:tags: momentum, conservation

Last full week of fall trimester


=====
Day 1
=====

 1. Start work on projects


=====
Day 2
=====

 1. Suppose you are an astronaut, floating some distance away from your ship, when you somehow become untethered.  How will you get back, if you don't have any kind of jetpack or other propulsion?  How long will it take you to get back?


=====
Day 3
=====

 1. The Superman Bullet Scene

.. youtube:: FLN3dPMyXeg

What *should* be the total change in momentum of Superman when the bullet hits his eye?  What would the resulting change in velocity be?  Is this consistent with what the film shows?  Is this consistent with what most movie gunshots depict?

 2. Presentation work

 1. Figure out what mass of gas is expelled by the rocket.  Clearly identify what quantities you have to estimate, and which you can calculate using those estimates

 2. Starting the momentum project presentations

 3. Work on any skills that you still need to improve on, or work on your presentation for the final block.
