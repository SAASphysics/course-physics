Day 1
=====

 1. New groups

 2. Effects of lifting and dropping experiment.  Take a block of wood and drop onto the head of a nail, which is resting on a block of styrofoam.  How far is the nail driven into the block of foam?  Does the depth depend on the height you drop the block from?  Does the depth depend on the mass of the block?  If so, how does it depend on these factors (linear, quadratic, etc)?

 3. Homework

Day 2
=====

 1. So our data on day 1 was a bit messy, and I suspect that it was in part due to using used styrofoam -- lots of swiss cheese holes in it made it tough to get a clean piece of foam.  So it may be a bit tough to interpret the results of the experiment.  What I want to know, though, is, do you think the data was consistent with linear relationships?  And if so, *why* do you think it *should* be linear (or not)?

 2. What kind of collision was it?  (Elastic, inelastic, completely inelastic?)

 3. What was the momentum of the block at the moment of impact?

 4. What was the velocity of the nail as it began to move into the styrofoam?

 5. What was the (average) acceleration on the nail caused by the foam?

 6. Do these help us understand whether the relationship *should* have been linear or not?

Day 3

 1. Convertible vs. non-convertible kinetic energy.  How come some of the energy in a collision is never converted into heat / sound / deformation / etc?  Even a perfectly inelastic collision, in which the colliding objects basically destroy each other, still has the two objects sliding together for a while -- which indicates that some of the initial kinetic energy *remains* as translational kinetic energy.  Why?

 2. It comes down to conservation of momentum.  Momentum is always conserved in closed systems, even in destructive collisions in which the kinetic energy is lost to incoherent forms of energy (like heat, sound, irreversible deformation, etc.).  Can we use the momentum principle to figure out how much of the energy remains, and how much *could* be converted into heat?

 3. (Yes)  Figure out the total momentum of the system before the collision.  The total momentum will remain constant, so after the collision there will still be the same momentum.  Divide the total momentum by the total mass of the system.  This is the *center of mass velocity*.  It's the velocity that the imaginary "center" of the system is moving at.  That velocity doesn't change during the collision (because momentum is conserved).

 4. What's the kinetic energy associated with that center of mass velocity?  It's the standard KE formula, using the total mass and the center of mass velocity -- :math:`KE_{CM} = \frac{1}{2} m_{tot} v^2_{cm}`.  That energy *must* remain as kinetic energy during the collision, so this is the *non*-convertible part of the total energy.  

 5. What's the total kinetic energy?  Add up the contributions from each particle separately. This is always bigger than the center of mass KE.

 6. The difference between these two Kinetic Energies is the convertible part -- it could be converted into heat while still maintaining conservation of momentum.  Whether or not it is converted to heat depends on what type of collision it is.  In a completely inelastic collision, *all* of the convertible kinetic energy *is* converted into heat.  In a completely elastic collision, *none* of the convertible kinetic energy is converted into heat.
