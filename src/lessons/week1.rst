1. Measure the velocity of the cart immediately before and immediately after it hits the edge.
2. Measure the velocity of the puck immediately after the hit
3. What is the relative velocity of the cart and the puck before and after?
4. Was momentum conserved?
5. Was energy conserved?  Should it be?


6. Estimate the mass of the cart and puck, and compute the momentum before  and the momentum after.  
7. Using your numbers from above, compute the kinetic energy before and after.  Is it conserved?  Should it be?
8. How far would  the puck slide before stopping if the velocity of the cart was doubled?

 1. Mark is going to work individually with the students responsible for problems 9, 11, and 29, and then have those students teach the problem to the rest of their groups.  These problems are heavily algebraic, and are intended as "proofs" of some relationships between the initial velocities and masses of colliding objects and their final velocities.  Proofs generally have two purposes: (1) to convince you that the relationship really is true, and (2) to give you some insight as to *why* it is true.  Algebraic proofs tend to be good for purpose 1, but most people don't seem to get much insight from them -- which is why I want to talk to each group about those problems.

 2. We're going to do a problem together: a mass of 2 kilograms, initially travelling with a velocity of :math:`5 \frac{m}{sec}\hat{i}` collides with a 5kg object initially at rest.  Predict the final velocities of each object if the collision is perfectly elastic.
