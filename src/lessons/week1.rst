Day 1
=====


Enrico Fermi was a Nobel Prize winning physicist who was famous in the physics community for his ability to calculate (in his head) remarkably precise answers to seemingly impossible questions.  He was present at the first test of an atomic bomb, the Trinity test at Alamogordo, New Mexico in 1945, and he was able to estimate the explosive yield of the bomb by dropping a piece of paper on theground and observing how far its flight deviated from straight down as the shockwave passed him.

 1. Question -- is it clear to everyone what you are trying to answer?
 2. Make a guess. Include a range of the lowest and highest possible values.
 3. Make an educated guess through a combination of calculation and estimation.
 4. Refine if necessary.

Day 2

 1. Estimating and figuring and unit conversion.

Fermi problems are really a kind of unit conversion:


    * There are approximately 9,000,000 people living in Chicago.
    * On average, there are two persons in each household in Chicago.
    * Roughly one household in twenty has a piano that is tuned regularly.
    * Pianos that are tuned regularly are tuned on average about once per year.
    * It takes a piano tuner about two hours to tune a piano, including travel time.
    * Each piano tuner works eight hours in a day, five days in a week, and 50 weeks in a year.

From these assumptions, we can compute that the number of piano tunings in a single year in Chicago is

    (9,000,000 persons in Chicago) / (2 persons/household) × (1 piano/20 households) × (1 piano tuning per piano per year) = 225,000 piano tunings per year in Chicago.

We can similarly calculate that the average piano tuner performs

    (50 weeks/year)×(5 days/week)×(8 hours/day)/(2 hours to tune a piano) = 1000 piano tunings per year per piano tuner.

Dividing gives

    (225,000 piano tunings per year in Chicago) / (1000 piano tunings per year per piano tuner) = 225 piano tuners in Chicago. 

You may quibble about the precise numbers used in each step, but if the task is to estimate how many piano tuners there are (rather than just look it up), these *are* the calculations you need to do.

Similarly, how do you:

 2. convert from feet to miles?

 3. convert from miles per hour to furlongs per fortnight?
