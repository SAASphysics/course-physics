We have been slowly working our way through an understanding of the frequency shift of sound according to observers that are moving relative to the source of the sound.  The key question we are trying to answer is, "Using sound, can we tell whether the source is moving toward a stationary observer? Or whether it is the observer moving toward the source?"

For a baseball, in the absence of air resistance and external reference points like trees, it is impossible to tell whether it is the ball moving away from the thrower, or the thrower moving away from the ball, and Galilean Relativity stipulates that no experiment should ever be able to distinguish relative motion like this -- because velocities are always relative to the source and to the observer.

But sound is an interesting case, because its velocity is not determined by the speed of the source, it is instead solely determined by the medium through which it travels -- just because a train is moving at 40 meters per second doesn't mean that the sound of its horn will travel at 385 meters per second.  Sound travels through air at 345 meters per second, because the thing that makes the sound keep moving is the compression and expansion of air molecules, with the molecules banging into each other in a coherent way to transmit the sound energy away.  The air molecules just won't move any faster than that, no matter what the source is doing.

This means that the speed of sound is **NOT** relative to the source and the observer -- it is relative to the medium through which it travels, and the motion of the *observer* through the medium. (If I am moving at 40 meters per second toward a sound wave, I would say that it is moving at 385 meters per second toward *me*, because it is traveling at 345 meters per second in the air)

Let's think about what different observers will perceive for a sound source that is moving relative to the medium, and for an observer that is moving relative to the medium.

The speed of a wave is :math:`w = \lambda f`

If the source of sound is stationary in the medium, and the observer is moving toward the source at speed :math:`v_{observer}`, then the apparent speed of the sound is :math:`w + v_{obs} = \lambda ' f'`.

The :math:`\lambda ' f'` comes from assuming that the moving observer might see a different wavelength and a different frequency.  But let's think about that -- does a moving observer measure distance any differently than a stationary observer? 

(**No**)  

Is the distance between each crest of the sound wave the same for all observers? 

(**Yes**).  That means the wavelength is actually the same for observers next to the source and for observers moving toward the source.

What about frequency?  As the observer moves toward the source, they will encounter crests of the sound wave more often than they would have if they were stationary.  How frequently one encounters a wave crest is exactly what we mean by *frequency*.  So the frequency of the sound will change, according to the moving observer.

:math:`\begin{eqnarray}
according to moving observer:&&& w + v_{obs} &=& \lambda f' \\
wavelength is same for both:&&& w &=& \lambda f \\
use (2) in (1):&&& w + v_{obs} &=& \frac{w}{f} f' \\
solve for f':&&& f' &=& \frac{w+v_{obs}}{w}f 
\end{eqnarray}` 


Check out this Desmos graph for an animation of this `frequency shift for a moving observer <https://www.desmos.com/calculator/wdghucoder>`_.  The observer (**blue dot**) passes a wave crest more often in this situation than they would if both the source and the observer were stationary.


Now consider the converse situation, in which the `observer is stationary, but the source is moving <https://www.desmos.com/calculator/vwgsocfc7b>`_.  In this case the frequency observed by the stationary observer is *also* higher than it would have been if they were both stationary, but the pattern of waves is different than if the source was stationary.  This may offer a way to determine whether it is the observer moving or the source moving, contrary to what happens with baseballs, where one cannot tell which is "really" moving.

Now, according to the source, the wave speed is :math:`w-v_{source}`.  And the source still thinks the frequency is unchanged.  But now the source thinks that the wavelength has *shortened*.  This is because the source moves in between each sound pulse emission, so it parially "catches up" to the sound wave that is moving ahead of it.  So the separation of two waves is smaller than the normal wavelength.

Both the source and the observer agreee about the wavelength, because everyone gets the sae answer for length measurements.  But the stationary observer hears a higher frequency.
