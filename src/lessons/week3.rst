No school Wednesday, but double blocks shifted (no Friday schedule this week)

Day 1
=====

 1. How do you find out about quizzes, skills, and how to improve?

  School code: SAAS

  username: school email address

  password: Ask Mark for your starting password, then change it

 2. I bought a bunch of "Constant Velocity Cars" last week from Carolina Biological Supply.  You would think that if you buy a "constant velocity car" that it would in fact move at a constant velocity., but I'm not really sure.  I'm suspicious.  So how do I go about finding out what speed they move at?  And how would I *prove* that it really is or isn't a constant velocity?

 3. I strongly recommend graphing your data as you produce it, using `desmos <http://desmos.com>`_

Day 2
=====

 1. Now I really want to see what you've come up with for the constant velocity cars.  If I'm going to sue them over their advertising claims, I need some really solid, convincing evidence.  Show me what you've got.

 2. Now I'm going to give you a second car, purchased from the same company.  I have the same questions, and I want an even more convincing case.  I want you to think carefully about the experimental issues with your procedure from Monday -- how can you get more *consistent* results?  How can you get more *correct* results?

 3. Homework assignment number 1 is due today.  Leave your lab notebook in class before you go.  It will be returned on Thursday when we will start our next homework assignment.
