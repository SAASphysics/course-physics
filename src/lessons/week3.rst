Project
=======

 Make your simulation correctly execute a completely inelastic collision. You should be able to change the masses and initial velocities of the two cars and the program will correctly calculate the result of the collision.

 Produce graphs of the momentum, kinetic energy, velocity, and position of the two cars in the completely inelastic collision.  Write about how these graphs demonstrate that kinetic energy is *not* conserved in an inelastic collision, but that momentum *is*.

Galilean Relativity
===================

One version of the "principle of relativity" has been known since at least Galileo's time -- that different observers will report different positions and velocities for objects in motion, depending on "where they are standing".  If different observers report different results for a measurement, then that measurement is "relative" to the observer's frame of reference.

How can we predict what other observers will say about different measurements?

We need to know how *their reference frame* is moving relative to us, and we need to know what the measurement is *for us*.  How do you transform the two measurements (of the object moving and of their reference frame moving) into a prediction about what *they would say* about the measurement of the object?

If velocity is relative to the observer, what other measurements are relative?  What measurements are *not* relative -- ie, every observer will get the same result, no matter how their reference frame is moving?
