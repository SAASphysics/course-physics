No school Wednesday (Veteran's Day), double blocks shifted (no Friday schedule)


=====
Day 1
=====

 1. Return Assessment 4 and get clear on how to improve skills scores

 2. Make a chart showing all the inputs and outputs to a bank account.  What is the relationship between the sum of all the Inflows and the sum of all the Outflows?

 3. Do the same for the cistern in the basement of the STREAM building.  What would happen if the Inflows were bigger than the Outflows?  What would happen if the Outflows were bigger than the Inflows?

 4. What about the water inputs and outputs for all of Seattle?  What about the globe?

 5. For many materials (like water), if you define the system large enough, you find that the Inflows are equal to the Outflows, or, equivalently, that the amount of stuff in the system doesn't change (Change = Inflow - Outflow).  What kinds of materials is it possible for the Inflow to **not** equal the Outflow?

Day 2
=====

 1. `Dart video <http://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dmvideos.org/players/blowdart_cart/blowdart_cart.html>`_ .  

 2. `Push-off 1 <http://serc.carleton.edu/dmvideos/players/cart_push_off_1.html?hide_banner=true>`_ .

 3. `Push-off 2 <http://serc.carleton.edu/dmvideos/players/cart_push_off_2.html?hide_banner=true>`_ .

 4. `Push-off 3 <http://serc.carleton.edu/dmvideos/players/cart_push_off_3.html?hide_banner=true>`_


For each of the videos, measure the velocities of the two objects before and after the interactions between them.  What do we notice about the results?  What information do we need to have in order to make sense of the results?

Day 3
=====

 1. Assessment 6.  Covering acceleration, motion, and some momentum.
