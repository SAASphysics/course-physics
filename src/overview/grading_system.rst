The grading system is designed to help you focus on improvement in understanding and in skills over time -- because the speed with which you pick up a new skill is not as important as the *depth* with which you get it and your ability to *apply it to new situations*, and because what we are really doing here is trying to help you learn *how to learn* and *how to create new knowledge*.  Physics is an ideal place to do this, because it is a field that is all about discovering how things work.

Thus the lion's share of the grade for the class is based on a list of specific skills and concepts (below), which will be assessed in some way on every assignment, every quiz, every project, etc.  If you give me hard evidence that you have mastered a particular skill *at any point in the trimester*, you will get an A for that particular skill, even if it takes you weeks and many attempts to get to that mastery.

You will receive a report on your progress on each of the skills of the course on a regular basis. It is *your* responsibility to work to improve on skills that you are struggling with, and to arrange for new assessment attempts. 

On each skill you will receive a score of 

 * 2 (green) Your work shows you have mastered the content/skill
 * 1 (yellow) Your work shows that you have partial mastery of the content/skill
 * 0 (red) Your work shows that you do not *yet* have mastery of the content/skill

Your grade will be calculated as:

 * 50 %:   (GreenPoints + YellowPoints)  divided by  2*(Total number of goals) 
 * 50 %:   Lab Notebook + Homework


You will receive feedback on your lab notebook on a regular basis.

Homework will be assigned out of the Principles and Practice of Physics textbook, and will be gradedbased on completion, not on correctness.  Homework is intended as practice and we will go over most of it in class.
