The grading system is designed to help you focus on improvement in understanding and in skills over time -- because the speed with which you pick up a new skill is not as important as the *depth* with which you get it and your ability to *apply it to new situations*, and because what we are really doing here is trying to help you learn *how to learn* and *how to create new knowledge*.  Physics is an ideal place to do this, because it is a field that is all about discovering how things work.

Thus the lion's share of the grade for the class is based on a list of specific skills and concepts (below), which will be assessed in some way on every assignment, every quiz, every project, etc.  If you give me hard evidence that you have mastered a particular skill *at any point in the trimester*, you will get an A for that particular skill, even if it takes you weeks and many attempts to get to that mastery.

You will receive a report on your progress on each of the skills of the course on a regular basis. It is *your* responsibility to work to improve on skills that you are struggling with, and to arrange for new assessment attempts. 

For each skill and concept, you will be scored using a 4 point rubric:

**4: Advanced**  

 * I understand the content/skills completely and can explain them in detail

 * I can explain/teach the skills to another student

 * I have high confidence on how to do the skills

 * I can have a conversation about the skills

 * I can independently demonstrate extensions of my knowledge

 * I can create analogies and/or find connections between different areas


**3: Proficient**

 * I understand the important things about the content/skills

 * I have confidence on how to do the skills on my own most of the time, but I need to continue practicing some parts that still give me problems.

 * I need my handouts and notes once in a while

 * I am proficient at describing terms and independently connecting them with concepts

 * I understand not just the "what," but can correctly explain the "how" and "why" of scientific processes

 * My responses demonstrate in-depth understanding of main ideas


**2: Developing**

 * I have a general understanding of the content/skills but Iâ€™m also confused about some important parts.

 * I need some help from my teacher (one-on-one or small group) to do the skills correctly

 * I do not feel confident enough to do the skills on my own

 * I rely on my handouts and notebook most of the time.

 * I can correctly identify concepts and/or define vocabulary; however I cannot not make connections among ideas and/or independently extend my own learning.

 * My responses demonstrate basic understanding of some main ideas, but significant information is missing.


**1: Beginning**

 * I need lots of help from my teacher (one-on-one).

 * I have low confidence on how to do the skills and need more instruction.

 * I need my handouts and science notebook at all times.

 * I do not understand the concept/skills.

 * I cannot correctly identify concepts and/or define vocabulary.

 * I cannot make connections among ideas or extend the information.

 * My responses lack detail necessary to demonstrate basic understanding.




Your overall grade will be determined by averaging all skills and concepts that relate to a particular overarching topic or unit of study, and then by combining your grades on each topic/unit.  You must meet with me at least twice per semester (before mid-tri and before end-of-tri) to discuss your progress and to assign an overall grade and plan for improvement.

**Earning an A** in the course requires: that you are advanced in at least one unit of study and proficient in all others.

**Earning a B** in the course requires: that you are proficient in most units of study

**Earning a C** in the course requires: that you are developing in most units of study and proficient in at least one

**Earning a D** in the course means that: you are beginning in most units of study and proficient in at least one.
