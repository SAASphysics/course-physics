I. Foundations (F.1 - 10)

   `F.1`_: I can differentiate between falsiable and un-falsiable hypotheses

   `F.2`_:  	I can explain the relationship between symmetry and physical law

   `F.3`_:	I can make comparisons between the sizes of objects and groups and estimate the size of other things through comparisons

   F.4:	I can identify the appropriate units for measurement of physical quantities

   F.5:	I can use conversion factors to compute simple conversions between different unit systems

   F.6:	I can use conversion tables to compute complex conversions between different quantities

   F.7:	I can identify the appropriate number of significant digits to reflect the precision of a measured quantity

The following outline corresponds roughly to chapters of the textbook, Eric Mazur's **Principles and Practice of Physics**.
