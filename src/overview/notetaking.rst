What's the deal with the notes?

1. To have a record of what happened on every day in class
2. To process into long-term memory the *big ideas*
3. To practice note-taking as a valuable skill in itself
4. To be able to notice interesting things, one must record them so they can be reflected upon 


Taking notes is hard.  In fact, it is so difficult that I almost don't recommend doing it.  The issue is that if your try to record everything in your notes, there isn't much space left for reflecting on what it means.  And research has shown that there is a bigger benefit to notes if you don't try to record everything, because you then have to think about what are the most important points.

I suspect that it is the meta-process of figuring out what is most important that is actually beneficial.

So in this class you will be given a composition book to record your *work* each day.  When a day starts, you should write the date down on a new page, and begin solving problems and figuring stuff out throughout the class.  If there's a handout, you should tape it into your notebook.  If we go over a problem, you should write a procedure down in your notes.  If you work on an experiment, you should record your methods and measurements in the notebook.

You should make a table of contents at the front, listing topics covered.  You should decide what title to give each day.  You will be allowed to keep this notebook with you during most assessments, so you should organize it in a way that will help you find information quickly.

Each student must write their own summary of the most important points of the
day *every day* as homework.  This will help you figure out what was important.  You will be given a google document to record these summaries.  Each day you should ask 

1. What did I do today?
2. Why did I do it?
3. What does it help me do or understand that I couldn't before?
4. What do I need to do tomorrow to keep improving?
