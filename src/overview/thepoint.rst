Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

 1.  Why don't you assign more homework?

Because I don't want to train you to believe that being sent home with a lot of extra work is okay and because a lot of research shows that homework isn't as beneficial as you might think.  Certainly practice is good, and practice on your own is good, but too much homework amounts to busy-work.  I want to hit the right amount where you are practicing and thinking on your own so you can reflect, but not so much that it takes over other aspects of your life *unless you want it to*.

 
 2. Why does it feel like I am on my own to figure out the homework?  In-class work doesn't prepare me for the homework.

Because the homework is an extension and I want you to struggle to figure it out.  If I had precisely prepared you to do the homework with what we had done in class, I wouldn't have assigned that homework because it would be redundant.

 3. I'm bored!  Not challenging enough.  Why is this class so slow?

I disagree that the class is slow.  The class is mixing conceptual with technical in a way that takes time.  Many students who tend to do well in fast-paced traditional math and science classes find this frustrating because they think all that "conceptual junk" is intended for the slow kids and is essentially dumbing down the **pure stuff** that "everyone should be able to handle anyway because they signed up for an honors course".

Some of that is snobbery.  And it simply doesn't help anyone.
