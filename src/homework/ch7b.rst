READ: Chapter 7 and 8 of Principles of Physics

DO:  

From Ch. 7 of Practice (p. 117): 7, 19, 23, 31

You may work together with your group, but every group member should do their own work on each of the problems.  (You can help each other, but the work written down in the notebook should be your own)


PROJECT:

Choose with your group one of the following problems: Ch. 6 # 80, 81, or 82; or Ch. 7 # 81,82, or 83

Your presentation on the project will take place during week 6.  You should work out a complete solution to the problem in your notebooks and prepare a presentation of the situation and your work for the class.  Try to focus on a presentation of the techniques you use to figure out aspects of the situation and what interesting things you are able to figure out, rather than just a recounting of the results -- think of it as *teaching*.

DUE: Tuesday, January 19
