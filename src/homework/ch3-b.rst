You can divide up the problems between your group however you see fit, but every member of the group should turn in complete solutions to each problem.  You should *not* just copy the answers down -- you should study the solutions made by your teammate, making suggestions for improvement, so you will fully understand the result.


CHOOSE: One problem from 43, 44, or 45.  Solve this problem in class, working with your group, and prepare a short (~5 minute presentation) on the problem and it's solution.



DUE: Monday, October 26
